                            For our Midsouth climate, we recommend composite decking, pressure-treated lumber, or exotic hardwoods like Ipe. Composite offers low maintenance and weather resistance, while pressure-treated lumber provides excellent value. We'll help you choose the best material based on your budget, maintenance preferences, and design goals.

                            Deck building timelines vary based on size and complexity.
