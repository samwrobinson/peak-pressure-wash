                    They did an amazing job on our windows inside and out. We live in the country so we have lots of bugs and spiderwebs. Not a trace of them when he was finished. He even cleaned our shower glass and it looked like new! We will definitely use him on a regular basis!

                    Great experience! I placed an order for Christmas lights through the website, received a text confirming, another text asking what color(s) and the approximate date of installation. Cameron and Helper(idk his name) showed on the prior-set date, ON TIME, and got to work right away. The lights looked great and the job was completed quickly!! I could not be happier. I am now looking forward to the future Christmas seasons!

                    I brought in Peak Pressure Washing to clean my driveway and sidewalks. Not only does my driveway look dramatically better, but the technician was very professional. He was on time, and while he finished quickly, he did a thorough job. He was also very careful around my landscaping. Highly recommend hiring this company.

                    Had them get a house ready to sell. Did pressure washing, painting, carpentry, landscaping. Did fantastic job. Words that come to mind are: Honest, Hardworking, Reliable. Stayed in touch any time they had any questions about what I was looking for with the job. WILL hire them again for work at new house.
